This program simulates three cars trying to find a parking space in a parking lot that has three islands of 20 cars. Cars randomly leave the parking lot with a Poisson distribution and the simulation reports the number of "seconds" that it takes for all cars to park.

Each car takes a different strategy in finding a parking spot.
In one second, each car has moved one space and checks if it is next to a free parking stall. If it is, the car will move into that stall.
